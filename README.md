# Stroke-Prediction-Factor-analysis

# Overview of study

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

# Research Problem
The research problem is to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to suffer stroke. The solution will help provide an indication of the key factors that affect the probability of suffering a stroke, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individualsâ€™ health
Method

# Model
The study uses Exploratory Data Analysis, i.e Univariate Analysis, Bivariate Analysis and Multivariate Analysis. In the study we seek to answer the following questions.

    Which factors are key in an individual suffering a stroke?
    What is the gender bias in the patient records?
    What age group of people is more likely to suffer a stroke?
